# Music Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset containing information about music tracks from Spotify. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express, the project explores various aspects of the dataset and presents visualizations to uncover insights and patterns.

## Key Components:

### Data Loading and Exploration:

- Load the dataset (`songs_normalize.csv`) using Pandas.
- Explore the dataset's structure, displaying columns, data types, and sample records.
- Provide basic statistical information for numerical columns.

### Data Cleaning:

- Identify and remove duplicate values from the dataset.

### Data Visualization:

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize Pearson correlation coefficients between numerical columns using a heatmap.
- **Feature Distribution Histograms**: Present a 3x3 grid of histograms showcasing the distribution of various features.
- **Year by Year Songs Collection**: Illustrate the trend of songs collected over the years using an area plot.
- **Total Songs Based on Genres**: Display a histogram representing the distribution of songs across different genres.
- **Popular Genres Based on Popularity**: Present a histogram depicting the distribution of genres based on their popularity.
- **List of Songs Recorded by Each Singer**: Show a bar plot highlighting the top 50 artists based on the number of songs recorded.
- **Top 30 Popular Singers**: Visualize the popularity of the top 30 singers using a bar plot.
- **Top 25 Songs in Spotify**: Display a line plot representing the popularity trend of the top 25 songs.
- **TreeMap of Singers Playlist**: Present a treemap representing the hierarchy of songs categorized by singer, genre, and song title.
- **Songs Having Explicit Content**: Show a pie chart depicting the distribution of songs based on their explicit content.
- **Yearwise Explicit Content Songs**: Illustrate the trend of explicit content songs over the years using an area plot.
- **Popularity Based on Explicit Content**: Present a box plot showcasing the distribution of song popularity based on their explicit content.
- **Tempo Versus Popularity**: Display a scatter plot depicting the relationship between tempo and popularity of songs.
- **Speechiness Versus Popularity**: Visualize the relationship between speechiness and popularity of songs using a scatter plot.
- **Energy Versus Danceability**: Present a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between energy and danceability attributes of songs.

Each visualization provides insights into different aspects of the music dataset, aiding in understanding trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
